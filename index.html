		<h1>Foundation-Wide Tech Goals</h1>
		<h2>Agreements<h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Backwards compability throughout these goals and in the future - or a migration path and good communication TBD</li>
			<li>No regression between goals, what worked before has to keep working</li>
			<li>Progress channel / log / one meet max per week</li>
			<li>Retrospect after the Goal has been achieved</li>
			<li>We always have 2 milestones in front of us that are detailed and worked out</li>
			<li>We always have 4 milstones in front of us that can be still vague</li>
		</ul>

				<h2>Goal #1: Our own websites on Swarm</h2>
				<p>In one sentence, the goal to achieve <br>
				We upload and can download our own websites (swarm.eth, docs.swarm.eth), through every Swarm product (bee, gateway, cli, chrome extension, dashboard/desktop).</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<h3>Measuring success</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>5 MB Zipped file w html, css, js.</li>
							<li>Can be uploaded/downloaded through the gateway, swarm-cli, dashboard/desktop, bee-curl</li>
							<li>70% of 5MB website uploads take up-to 2 minutes</li>
							<li>70% of 5mb website downloads take up-to 20 seconds</li>
							<li>The websites can be accessed through a human name w/o doing a blockchain tx for every update</li>				
						</ul>
						<p>ETA: 21 Oct 2021 +3 months</p>
					</li> <!-- Measuring success -->
					<li>
						<h3>Value</h3>
						<p>How does the world benefit, when this goal is achieved: <br>
						Publishers and other organisations have a way to publish information in a non-censorable way. This guarantees freedom of information, which is a human right. If we meet this goal, data can start flowing through the network which in itself provides us with the information needed to test and improve the different software tools.</p>
					</li> <!-- Value -->
				</ol>
			</li> <!-- Goal #1: Our own websites on Swarm -->
			<li>
				<h2>Goal #2: It’s easy and understandable to set up and interact with a Bee node</h2>
				<p>Any crypto enthusiast with an interest in Swarm can set up and run a Bee node easily.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<h3>Measuring Success</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Following the documentation or following a user journey, setting up a node on Mac, Windows and Linux can be done in under 30’ in >70% of the cases.</li>
							<li>This will be measured by witnessing newly-joined Discord members set up their node.</li>
							<li>Onboarding to tokens etc via docs</li>
							<li>Reasonable security for api’s ???</li>
							<li>It works on Mainnet and testnet</li>
							<li>Insight of the workings of the Bee node</li>
							<li>Control over basic parameters</li>
						</ul>
					</li> <!-- Measuring Success -->
					<li>
						<h3>Timebox</h3>
						<p>Goal#1 + 2 months</p>
					</li> <!-- Timebox -->
					<li>
						<h3>Value</h3>
						<p>how does the world benefit, when this goal is achieved <br>
						If it is trivial to set up a Bee node, more of them will be set up. This will result in more node operators, and a stronger network.</p>
					</li> 
				</ol>
			</li> <!-- Goal #2: It’s easy and understandable to set up and interact with a Bee node -->
			<li>
				<h2>Goal #3: Keep my data on Swarm for as long as I choose (incentives)</h2>
				<p>In one sentence, the goal to achieve <br>
				I can pay to have my content persisted on Swarm. <br>
				This payment is distributed to node operators</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<h3>Measuring success</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Upload a 5MB file like a website (Goal #1),</li>
							<li>Pay for a stamp in x interface</li>
							<li>Check every day for 2 weeks if it is still there? :) And it’s still there</li>
							<li>If the network is not under attack</li>
							<li>I have visibility on the status / value of my postage stamp / incentive value</li>
							<li>If the lifespan of your node is long enough you will “profit” from the revenue redistribution of wealth in Swarm network</li>
							<li>As a node operator I can monitor my earnings</li>
						</ul>
					</li> <!-- Measuring success -->
					<li>
						<h3>Nice to have</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>No staking, no challenge, no commit reveal</li>
						</ul>
					</li> <!-- Nice to have -->
					<li>
						<h3>Value</h3>
						<p>
							how does the world benefit, when this goal is achieved <br>
							Archives, backups, …
						</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li><!--  Goal #3: Keep my data on Swarm for as long as I choose (incentives) -->
			<li>
				<h2>Goal #4: Upload and download a 2.4GB file</h2>
				<p>Uploading and downloading the Bunny movie works.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<h3>Measuring success</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>I can upload and retrieve a free movie (2.4 GB) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Buck_Bunny</li>
							<li>Synced under X min</li>
							<li>Retrievable from any node in under X seconds</li>
							<li>Can be uploaded/downloaded through the gateway, swarm-cli, dashboard/desktop, bee-curl</li>
							<li>99% of the time this works</li>
							<li>I can see the status of the upload</li>
							<li>We assume a good network connection and check for this</li>
							<li>Uploads can be resumed</li>
							<li>Seek into the movie (random access on the file)</li>
							<li>Have a good UX for postage stamp payment</li>
						</ul>

			<li>
				<h2>Goal #5: Swarm Demo App.</h2>
				<p>SN-App into it!</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<h3>Measuring success</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Developers who are comfortable with React JS can easily clone a repo or npx install a Swarm Native Starter App</li>
							<li>
								The SNApp shows off:
								<ul>
									<li>notifications,</li>
									<li>feeds</li>
									<li>...</li>
